    | Let's say this much for Rudi Garcia's Roma, at least they're consistent. From rattling off six straight wins to start the season, to drawing 13 of 21 matches through the winter, to now losing two straight matches by a combined score of 5-0, when Roma finds a groove she likes, she sticks with it come hell or high water. The latest blemish on Roma's dreadful 2015 was a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of Fiorentina in the second leg of today's Europa League Round of 16 match, one in which the Giallorossi were done and dusted practically from the word go, surrendering a penalty in only the ninth minute of the match.

Marcos Alonso and Jose Basanta would follow up Gonzalo Rodriguez's ninth minute penalty to end Roma's Europa League campaign in the span of 12 minutes. You know how it goes by now: Roma held a greater degree of possession, took more shots, completed a higher percentage of their passes and created more scoring chances, yet, due to poor finishing, sloppy defending and horrid...and I mean horrid...goalkeeping were left wanting and are now on the outside looking in at UEFA's lesser competition.

Roma's 2015 has drained every ounce of wit and cogency from my fingers, so let's see what the stakeholders had to say about today's debacle.
